# STM32 Linear Inverted Pendulum — Custom Controller Platform

A hardware abstraction layer for the **Wheeltec IP570 linear inverted pendulum**, extracted and ported to STM32CubeIDE (HAL) as a clean foundation for implementing custom control algorithms.

The original manufacturer firmware (Wheeltec / MiniBalance) came bundled with a proprietary PID controller in a Keil-only project. This repository strips away the control logic entirely and replaces it with a buildable, open STM32CubeIDE project — leaving the control layer as a blank slate where any algorithm can be dropped in.

Inspired by [playfultechnology/pid-invertedpendulum](https://github.com/playfultechnology/pid-invertedpendulum), which went through a similar reverse-engineering process on the same hardware.

- **Position sensor:** Linear encoder via TIM4 quadrature input
- **Actuator:** DC motor with H-bridge, driven by 10 kHz PWM
- **Display:** 128×64 OLED (I2C)
- **Programmer:** ST-Link v2

The 5 ms control interrupt fires in `stm32f1xx_it.c`. All sensor reads and motor output happen there. Reading the angle and position, and writing the PWM, requires only standard HAL calls:

```c
// Read pendulum angle (ADC, 12-bit, 0–4095)
HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc1);
HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hadc1, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
uint32_t angle_raw = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc1);

// Read cart position (quadrature encoder, TIM4)
int32_t position = (int32_t)__HAL_TIM_GET_COUNTER(&htim4);

// Set motor PWM (TIM3 CH1/CH2, range ±7199)
__HAL_TIM_SET_COMPARE(&htim3, TIM_CHANNEL_1, pwm_value);
```

## Sensor calibration

Before running any control algorithm, the angle sensor must be calibrated so that the pendulum hanging straight down reads a known ADC value (~1024).

1. Power on the board and let it sit idle
2. Hold the pendulum pointing straight down
3. Loosen the top screw connecting the pendulum rod to the encoder shaft
4. Slowly twist the encoder knob until the ADC value on the OLED reads between 1010–1030 (target: 1024)
5. Retighten the screw

The OLED screen shows live sensor readings during this process — ADC (angle), P (position), VOL (battery voltage).

### Runtime mode and homing

The firmware uses the reserved button on `PA0` for two functions:

- Short press: toggle between `RUN` and `CAL`
- Long press: start homing to the fixed right-wall reference

In `CAL`, the motor output is disabled while telemetry and OLED updates remain active. Use this mode for open-loop checks, sign verification, and sensor calibration.

Right-wall homing is a command to return to the fixed right-wall reference, not a free-form reference capture.

The cart position is homed from the right wall. If the cart is at the right wall and the travel span is the full usable range, the midpoint is simply half that span. With the current encoder limits, the midpoint is approximately halfway between the right-wall home and the left limit.

## Getting started

**Requirements:**
- [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html) or VS Code + PlatformIO IDE extension
- ST-Link v2 USB programmer (or serial uploader if configured)

**Steps (PlatformIO):**
1. Clone this repo
2. Build firmware: `pio run`
3. Upload firmware: `pio run -t upload`
4. Edit the control algorithm in `src/main.c`

### Button map

- `User_key` on `PA5`: emergency start/stop behavior in the current firmware flow
- `menu_key` on `PA7`: set angle zero
- `reserved_key` on `PA0`: short press toggles `RUN/CAL`, long press starts homing to the fixed right-wall reference
- `pid_plus` / `pid_reduce`: manual jog / torque trim during open-loop checks when enabled

### Phase 2 Serial Link Test (PC <-> STM32)

Use the binary protocol bridge script to validate telemetry + command packets:

```bash
python3 tools/serial_link.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --mode 0
```

Send a sine-wave command (test in `SWINGUP` mode):

```bash
python3 tools/serial_link.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --mode 1 --sine --amp 0.25 --freq 0.5
```

Install dependency once:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyserial
```

**Optional (CubeMX/CubeIDE reference):**
- Original CubeMX metadata and linker script are kept in `project/` for pin/peripheral regeneration and reference.
