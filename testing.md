# Phase 1: Motor Travel Range Characterization

## Test Results

**Date**: March 26, 2026  
**Platform**: STM32F103C8T6 @ 72MHz  
**Motor**: DC Motor with Quadrature Encoder (TIM4 encoder mode)  
**PWM Duty**: 50% (3500/7199)

### Measurements

| Parameter | Value | Unit |
|-----------|-------|------|
| **LEFT WALL Position** | 4040 | encoder pulses |
| **RIGHT WALL Position** | 0 | encoder pulses |
| **Usable Travel Range** | 4040 | encoder pulses |

### Test Procedure

The encoder is treated as a **relative position from the right-wall home reference**.
In the current setup, the reserved button is used to command a return to the fixed right-wall home before closed-loop testing.

### Homing Procedure

1. Drive the cart to the right wall.
2. Hold the reserved button to command the cart back to the fixed right-wall home.
3. Verify on OLED that the state shows homing while the cart is moving back.
4. The cart will stop automatically when it reaches the home threshold.

1. **LEFT Phase**:
   - Motor runs at 50% PWM toward left wall
   - Collision detection: encoder stable for 3 readings (~900ms) = stops
   - Captures: 4040 pulses

2. **RIGHT Phase**:
   - Motor continues from left position, reverses direction
   - Runs toward right wall at 50% PWM
   - Collision detection: encoder stable for 3 readings = stops
   - Captures: 0 pulses

### Key Findings

- Motor spans **4040 encoder pulses** from right wall to left wall in the current convention
- Encoder should be treated as relative-per-home data, with right wall as the home reference in this measurement setup
- Collision detection via stability counting works reliably
- No issues with motor reversing or direction control

### Next Steps

1. **Calibration**: Measure wall-to-wall distance (meters) to get conversion factor
   - **Conversion**: [distance in meters] / 4040 pulses = meters/pulse

2. **Control Workflow**: Use the reserved button to toggle `RUN/CAL` and store the right-wall home before swing-up tests

3. **Dead-zone Testing**: Determine minimum PWM needed for motor to start moving

4. **LQR Controller Design**: Use travel range for state boundaries and control limits
